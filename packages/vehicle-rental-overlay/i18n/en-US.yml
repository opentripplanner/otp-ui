# Default messages for the VehicleRentalOverlay component.
# To use from a react-intl application:
# - merge the content of this file into the messages object
#   that has your other localized strings,
# - flatten the ids, i.e. convert a structure such as
#      otpUi > VehicleRentalOverlay > availableBikes
#   into "otpUi.VehicleRentalOverlay.availableBikes".
# - pass the resulting object to the messages prop of IntlProvider.
#

otpUi:
  VehicleRentalOverlay:
    availableBikes: "Available bikes: {value}"
    availableDocks: "Available docks: {value}"
    floatingBike: "Free-floating bike: {name}"
    floatingCar: "{company} {name}" # as in "CarCompany Veh1234a"
    floatingEScooter: "E-scooter: {name}"
