Includes various utility functions to assist with common operations dealing with OpenTripPlanner data.

This package depends on [`Intl.DateTimeFormat`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/DateTimeFormat), which is not supported by older browsers or node versions. [As can be seen here](https://caniuse.com/?search=Intl.DateTimeFormat), support is fairly significant across major browsers. Should older browsers need to be targeted, a polyfill can be added. Such a polyfill is available [here](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-datetimeformat/).

This package depends on the [date-fns library](https://date-fns.org), which relies on Node version 13 and above. Should this library be used for **server side rendering**, Node version 13 or above must be used.
